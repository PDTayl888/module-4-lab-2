Reflection Questions
After completing this lab, reflect on the following questions:

How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
    push allowed me to easily add an item to the list of items only when needed and in a consistent manner. I made my own version of the filter method with the same functionality but using a for loop.

What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
    I kept returning the results of the loop at the wrong time so I wasn't getting all of the results neccessary.

How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
    I would make a much richer and pleasant looking visual UI
