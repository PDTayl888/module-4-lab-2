Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will have demonstrated your ability to:

Use array methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() to manipulate arrays.
Filter and transform arrays using JavaScript array methods.
Dynamically display the contents of arrays on a webpage.
Write clean, maintainable JavaScript code to handle array operations.


Instructions
Task 1: Array Manipulation Basics
Create an empty array called shoppingList.
Write a function called addItem that takes an item as a parameter and adds it to the shoppingList array.
Write a function called removeLastItem that removes the last item from the shoppingList array.
Write a function called displayList that logs all items in the shoppingList array to the console.


Task 2: Filter and Search an Array
Modify the addItem function to only add the item if it is not already in the shoppingList array.
Write a function called filterItems that takes a search term as a parameter and returns all items in the shoppingList that contain that search term (case-insensitive).


Task 3: Render the List in the Browser
Create an HTML page with an input field, an “Add Item” button, and an unordered list to display the items.
Write a JavaScript function that adds items to the array and updates the displayed list dynamically when the button is clicked.
Write another function that removes the last item and updates the displayed list when a “Remove Last Item” button is clicked.
